# Automate-Health-Checks-with-a-Bash-Script

Scenario:
Your manager wants you to regularly check the system health of a RHEL server. Instead of running the same commands by hand, you write a simple Bash script to gather and display:

- Hostname and uptime
- Disk usage summary
- Recent failed logins
- Running services (httpd)

### Task 1: Create a New Bash Script
Step 1: Switch to your home directory (if not already there)
